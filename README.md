2014 Hackathon : POI-Pointer
================

This app would locate all the beauties in Brussels that usually go unnoticed.
That's an app. you'd use when you have time on your hands to explore and wonder.
When entering a specific perimeter around one of those beauties (that could be a statue, a monument, a remarquable tree,... to be discussed by the team if the idea is retained, really!), your app would notify you and, if you wish to, would guide you to the targeted place. If available, it could provide you with informations about it.
