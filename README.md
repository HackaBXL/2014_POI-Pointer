PoiPointer -- Point of Interest Pointer
=======================================

Implemented during the 2014 hackathon.

This app helps you locate all the beauties in Brussels that usually go unnoticed.

Use this iOS or Android app when you have time on your hands to explore, be surprised and impressed.

When entering a specific perimeter around one of those beauties -- e.g., a statue, a monument, a remarkable tree, etc. -- PoiPointer will notify you, provide information and optionally guide you to the targeted place.
